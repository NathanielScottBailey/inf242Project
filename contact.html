                <p> Suzanne Collins (THG Author) Success! - March 11th, 2013</p>
                <p>
                  I will not give out the address. If I could find it from doing some searching, you can find it. Sent: End of June 2012 What I sent: LOR (almost 3 pages), my copy of THG, my book jacket for Catching Fire, $8 cash, and a padded self addressed envelope Received: March 11, 2013 What I received: my book and book jacket both signed and personalized with my $8 back It didnt take me that long to find her address. I sent it to her private home address. I honestly was not sure if it was her address and I wasnt expecting it back. I sent a padded envelope to be sent back to me that I wrote my address on. The return address looks to be written by her and it is the Scholastic address: Scholastic 557 Broadway New York, NY 10012 I seriously am having trouble typing this because when I opened my mailbox up today this was the last thing I expected. I saw the envelope and said to myself "..if this is what I think it is....." and I saw my hand writing I knew it was but when I saw the Scholastic return address I thought that it probably would just be returned to me with that stupid letter from Scholastic. But - it wasnt: THG: - Catching Fire (the "To Caimen" is on the top of the jacket) : - Envelope: -
